            <p>Hey everyone! Welcome to my portfolio site! I have just started my path to become a web developer and could'nt be more excited for the challenge. Back when I was deciding what to do for college, I felt that coding was too difficult for me to learn, since I had friends that had been coding throughout high school. Now I have business degree, but was still craving that challenge. I finally decided to take the plunge and work my hardest to become a full-stack web developer!</p>
            <p>This website is just beginning and getting ready to grow. For now you will see various links that lead to basic portfolio and contact pages, but as I continue to learn in this course, my portfolio page will begin to showcase some of my actual works, but for now you can enjoy some great pictures of the different Spider-Men from the Oscar winning movie, "Into the Spiderverse". If there are any questions you might have, you can head over to the contact page where you will eventually be able to send me an inquiry where I can get back to you as soon as possible. </p>
            <p>I am looking forward to the rest of this class, and the future beyond it. My desire is to utilize these skills in any capacity within the video game industry, where I can continue to grow and hone my skills for years to come. Thank you for stopping by!</p>
